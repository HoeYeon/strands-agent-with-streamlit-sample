## Business Logic & Value Descriptions

### ViewCount (View Count)

- commonsense evidence:
- Higher view count means the post has higher popularity

### FavoriteCount (Favorite Count)

- commonsense evidence:
- more favorite count refers to more valuable posts.

### ParentId

- commonsense evidence:
- If the parent id is null, the post is the root post. Otherwise, the post is the child post of other post.

### ClosedDate (Closed Date)

- commonsense evidence:
- if ClosedDate is null or empty, it means this post is not well-finished
- if CloseDate is not null or empty, it means this post has well-finished.
