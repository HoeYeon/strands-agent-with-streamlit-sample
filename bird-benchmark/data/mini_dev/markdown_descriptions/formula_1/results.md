## Business Logic & Value Descriptions

### positionText (position text)

- not quite useful

### time

- commonsense evidence:
- 1. if the value exists, it means the driver finished the race.
- 2. Only the time of the champion shows in the format of "minutes: seconds.millionsecond", the time of the other drivers shows as "seconds.millionsecond" , which means their actual time is the time of the champion adding the value in this cell.

### milliseconds

- the actual finishing time of drivers

### fastestLapTime (fastest Lap Time)

- faster (smaller in the value) "fastestLapTime" leads to higher rank (smaller is higher rank)

### fastestLapSpeed (fastest Lap Speed)

- (km / h)

### statusId (status Id)

- its category description appear in the table status
